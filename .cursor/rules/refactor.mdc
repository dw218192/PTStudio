This project is undergoing a major refactor to
1. make the codebase more maintainable
2. transition to a better architecture so that renderers are truly modular/pluggable and the ownership of resources is clearer.

## Convention to help identify old and new code
- Old code is moved to the `legacy` directory and may be moved out or deleted in the future.
- New code uses the `pts` namespace, as opposed to the `PTS` namespace.
