## Build System Overview
This project uses conan as the package manager and cmake as the build system generator. Conan fetches dependencies based on the `conanfile.py` file, generates cmake modules in `_build/<configuration>`. Cmake is then invoked to generate the build system.

## Build System Commands
There is a convenience script `build.ps1` that can be used to pull deps, configure, and build the project.
```powershell
./build.ps1
```

## Build System Flags
-x: Rebuild the build folder before building
-u: Update the lock file before building
-c: Configure only mode: runs conan install and cmake configure, but skips building
-BuildType: The build configuration type, defaults to Debug
-ConanProfile: The conan profile, defaults to default
