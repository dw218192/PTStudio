## Build System Overview
This project uses conan as the package manager and cmake as the build system generator. Conan fetches dependencies based on the `conanfile.py` file, generates cmake modules in `_build/<configuration>`. Cmake is then invoked to generate the build system.

All the tools are pulled in as Python packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file. This makes the tooling host-independent and self-contained.

The scripts that initialize and invoke the build system are located in the `tools` folder. They are written in Python and use the `repo_tools` package to register commands and parse arguments. The entrypoint is the OS-dependent `pts` scripts at the root of the repository.

## Common Commands
To build the project, run:
```powershell
pts.cmd build
```

  -u, --update-lock     Update lock flag: forces regeneration of conan.lock
  -c, --configure-only  Configure only flag: runs conan install and cmake configure, but skips building
  -b, --build-only      Build only flag: skips conan install and cmake configure, only runs build
  --build-type {Debug,Release,RelWithDebInfo,MinSizeRel}
                        Build configuration type (default: Debug)
